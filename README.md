# ged
Ged project is a collection of tools useful for genealogical research:
- search in a csv file  genealogical database: the database is a simple csv text file, with a row for each person
- source image management and search: useful to browse digitalized record books, where images are ordered, and each image has a date and a type (i.e. birth, marriage, death)
- interaction with a PhpGedView website via SOAP: used to crosscheck data between the csv database and a PhpGedView website
